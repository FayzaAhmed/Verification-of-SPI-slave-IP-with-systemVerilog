# Verification-of-SPI-slave-IP-with-systemVerilog:
In this project, we test an SPI slave IP using systemVerilog. The testing will be incorporating new features offered by SystemVerilog such as interfaces, classes, constrained-random stimulus generation, and coverage-driven verification methodologies.
